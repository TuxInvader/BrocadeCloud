#VMWare VCloud Director AutoScaling Driver
============

This is an autoscaler for VMware VCloud Director.  

The AutoScaler will deploy new Virtual Machines from "single machine" vAPP Templates into you running vAPP.

## Configuration

Follow the steps below to set up the AutoScaler with VCD.

### Upload The Driver

Upload the vclouddriver.py file into `Catalogs -> Extra Files -> Miscellaneous` and remember to mark it as executable.

### Upload a VCD-VAPP Configuration

Upload a configuration file for the vAPP you are autoscaling into `Catalogs -> Miscellaneous`. This one does
not neet to be executable. You will need a configuration file for each vAPP you want to AutoScale.  

For Example::  

```
apiHost   https://mycloud.mycompany.net/api
user      mark@brocade
pass      marksPassword
org       brocade
vdc       brocade-emea
vapp      testapp
pubNet    Direct Internet connection
privNet   private_network_1
networks  private_network_2, private_network_3, private_network_4
ipMode    POOL
customize true
sizeid    any
```

You should set the `apiHost, user, and pass` to match the VCD API you will be connecting to. The `org, and vdc`
should match your VCloud Organization, and Virtual Data Center names. The `vapp` is the name of the VApp which
we will be deploying machines into.  

You must provide at least one network. This can be any combination of `pubNet`, `privNet` and `networks`. 
The `pubNet` and `privNet` options should contain a single named network, while the `networks` option can be a
comma separated list. Obviously the named networks must exist in your VApp.  

The `ipMode` setting should be either `POOL` or `DHCP` to match the IP Allocation method you are using.  

VCD will run Guest Customization if your template requires them, but if you want to explicitly request them, 
then you can set the optional `customize` parameter to `true` 

The `sizeid` value can be any string you like, but it must match the `Machine Type` you set on your pool.  

### Create Cloud Credentials

Once the driver and configuration files are uploaded, you will be able to create a set of Cloud Credentials under 
`Catalogs -> Cloud Credentials`. You should select the vclouddriver.py as the Cloud API, and you should enter the
name of your configuration file as Credential 1.  

For Example:
```
Name:          vcd-vapp1
Cloud API:     vclouddriver.py
Credential 1:  vcd-vapp1.cfg
Credential 2:  Unused, but you must enter something
```

## Setting up an AutoScale Pool

Once you have configured the VCD for your vApp, you will need to create the AutoScaling pool. Create a pool under
`Services - Pools`. You don't need to provide any nodes obviously, just give it a name and tick the "use autoscaling"
box.  

You should now be at the AutoScaler settings: `Services -> Pools -> [Pool Name] -> AutoScaling`. Set `autoscale!external`
to "no", and then set `Cloud Credentials` to your new VCD Credentials. The `Image ID` needs to be set to the name of the
vApp Template that you will be cloning VMs from. You need to enter a value in `Machine Type` and it should match the
`sizeid` value you entered in your vapp configuration file.  
Finally set the `Name Prefix` to something appropriate.  

For Example:
```
autoscale!enabled:     yes
autoscale!external:    no
Cloud Credentials:     vcd-vapp1-cc (vclouddriver.py)
Image ID:              Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
Machine Type:          any
Name Prefix:           web
```

Review the other settings, and click `update` when ready.

That's it, you're done!

##Notes

### VCD Metadata
The size of all Metadata for an object, computed as the sum of all Key and TypedValue UTF-8 strings in all 
MetadataEntry elements in the GENERAL domain, cannot exceed 128 KB. An additional 16KB of MetadataEntry 
content can be created in the SYSTEM domain.

We store the last two status runs in the VApp metadata. This works out at ~250 bytes (237 + vmName) per node
in the Vapp, per run, so the history uses ~500 (2 * 250) bytes per VM in the VApp.  

If The autoScaler is the only thing putting metadata on the VApp, this means we'll run into storage issues
if we need to track more than 250 VMs in a single VApp.

We also store a single "created" timestamp in each autoscaled node.
